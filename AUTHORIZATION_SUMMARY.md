# Authorization Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added authorization checks to restrict access to specific commands to only authorized users, improving bot security and preventing unauthorized usage.

## Commands with Authorization Added

### **🔒 AUTH_USERS Only Commands:**
These commands now require the user to be in the `AUTH_USERS` list:

| Command | Description | Authorization Level |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `/drm` | Extract from .txt files | AUTH_USERS |
| `/cookies` | Update YouTube cookies | AUTH_USERS |
| `/y2t` | YouTube to .txt converter | AUTH_USERS |
| `/t2t` | Text to .txt generator | AUTH_USERS |
| `/stop` | Cancel running tasks | AUTH_USERS |
| `/logs` | View bot activity logs | AUTH_USERS |
| `/add_channel` | Add channel to authorized list | AUTH_USERS |
| `/remove_channel` | Remove channel from list | AUTH_USERS |
| **Single Link Processing** | Direct link sending | AUTH_USERS |

### **👑 OWNER Only Commands:**
These commands remain restricted to the bot owner only:

| Command | Description | Authorization Level |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `/add_user` | Add user to authorized list | OWNER |
| `/remove_user` | Remove user from authorized list | OWNER |
| `/users` | List all authorized users | OWNER |
| `/channels` | List all authorized channels | OWNER |

### **🌐 Public Commands:**
These commands remain accessible to everyone:

| Command | Description | Authorization Level |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `/start` | Bot status and welcome | Public |
| `/help` | Show commands list | Public |
| `/id` | Get chat/user ID | Public |
| `/info` | Get user information | Public |

## Implementation Details

### **Authorization Check Pattern:**
```python
# For AUTH_USERS commands
if m.from_user.id not in AUTH_USERS:
    return await m.reply_text("❌ You are not authorized to use this command. Contact the bot owner for access.")

# For OWNER only commands  
if message.chat.id != OWNER:
    return await message.reply_text("You are not authorized to use this command.")
```

### **Updated Commands:**

#### 1. `/drm` Command
```python
@bot.on_message(filters.command(["drm"]) )
async def txt_handler_with_retry(bot: Client, m: Message):
    # Check if user is authorized
    if m.from_user.id not in AUTH_USERS:
        return await m.reply_text("❌ You are not authorized to use this command. Contact the bot owner for access.")
```

#### 2. `/cookies` Command
```python
@bot.on_message(filters.command("cookies") & filters.private)
async def cookies_handler(client: Client, m: Message):
    # Check if user is authorized
    if m.from_user.id not in AUTH_USERS:
        return await m.reply_text("❌ You are not authorized to use this command. Contact the bot owner for access.")
```

#### 3. Single Link Processing
```python
@bot.on_message(filters.text & filters.private)
async def text_handler(bot: Client, m: Message):
    if m.from_user.is_bot:
        return
    
    # Check if user is authorized for single link processing
    if m.from_user.id not in AUTH_USERS:
        return await m.reply_text("❌ You are not authorized to use this bot. Contact the bot owner for access.")
```

## Updated Help Command

### **Visual Indicators:**
- 🔒 = Requires authorization (AUTH_USERS)
- 👑 = Owner only
- No icon = Public access

### **Help Text Updated:**
```
📌 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀: (Auth Users Only)

➥ /drm – Extract from .txt (Auto) 🔒
➥ /y2t – YouTube → .txt Converter 🔒
➥ /t2t – Text → .txt Generator 🔒
➥ /stop – Cancel Running Task 🔒

⚙️ 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 & 𝗦𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀:

➥ /cookies – Update YT Cookies 🔒
➥ /logs – View Bot Activity 🔒
```

## Security Benefits

### **✅ Improved Security:**
- Prevents unauthorized users from using resource-intensive commands
- Protects sensitive operations like cookie updates
- Controls access to file processing features

### **✅ Resource Management:**
- Limits bot usage to authorized users only
- Prevents spam and abuse
- Better control over server resources

### **✅ User Experience:**
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access
- Consistent authorization flow
- Easy to understand permission levels

## Authorization Flow

### **For New Users:**
1. User tries to use a restricted command
2. Bot checks if user ID is in AUTH_USERS
3. If not authorized: Shows error message
4. User contacts bot owner for access
5. Owner uses `/add_user` to grant access

### **For Authorized Users:**
1. User sends restricted command
2. Bot verifies user is in AUTH_USERS
3. Command executes normally

## Files Modified

### **main.py:**
- Added authorization checks to 8 commands
- Updated help command with visual indicators
- Added authorization to single link processing

## Testing Authorization

### **Test Unauthorized Access:**
```
# Try these commands with unauthorized user:
/drm
/cookies
/y2t
/t2t
/stop
/logs

# Expected: "❌ You are not authorized to use this command..."
```

### **Test Authorized Access:**
```
# First add user to AUTH_USERS:
/add_user 123456789

# Then test commands work normally
```

## Summary

✅ **8 commands now require authorization**  
✅ **Clear error messages for unauthorized users**  
✅ **Help command updated with visual indicators**  
✅ **Single link processing also protected**  
✅ **Owner commands remain owner-only**  
✅ **Public commands remain accessible**  
✅ **Improved bot security and resource management**

The bot now has proper access control while maintaining usability for authorized users.
